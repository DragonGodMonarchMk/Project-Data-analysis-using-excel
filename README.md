In the beginning, the case was just data for a company that did not indicate any useful information that would help decision-makers. In this case, I had to ask questions that could help extract and explore information that would help decision-makers improve and evaluate performance.
About Dataset
In the beginning, the case was just data for a company that did not indicate any useful information that would help decision-makers. In this case, I had to ask questions that could help extract and explore information that would help decision-makers improve and evaluate performance.
But before that, I did some operations in the data to help me to analyze it accurately:
1- Understand the data.
2- Clean the data “By power query”.
3- insert some calculation and columns like “COGS” cost of goods sold by power query.
4- Modeling the data and adding some measures and other columns to help me in analysis.
Then I asked these questions:
To Enhance Customer Loyalty
What is the most used ship mode by our customer?
Who are our top 5 customers in terms of sales and order frequency?
To monitor our strength and weak points
Which segment of clients generates the most sales?
Which city has the most sales value?
Which state generates the most sales value?
Performance measurement
What are the top performing product categories in terms of sales and profit?
What is the most profitable product that we sell?
What is the lowest profitable product that we sell?
Customer Experience
On Average how long does it take the orders to reach our clients? Based on each Shipping Mode

Then started extracting her summaries and answers from the pivot tables and designing the data graphics in a dashboard for easy communication and reading of the information as well.
And after completing these operations, I made some calculations related to the KPI to calculate the extent to which sales officials achieved and the extent to which they achieved the target.
